# Session 8 Homework: Plotting

This sessions homework include 6 exercises in the form of questions which help better conprehend the topics of the session:

### 1. Matplotlib and Seaborn 
**Matplotlib** is the most extended plotting tool in the Python community. While **Maptplotlib** can be call through **Pandas**, **Seaborn** offers a tight integration with **Pandas**.
**Seaborn**, built on top of **Matplotlib**, can be seen as a **Matplotlib** with stereoids, where its main contribution is to simplify heavy tasks (complex to do them with just **Matplotlib**) and provide enhanced visualizations (cooler styles and color palettes). 

### 2. Plotting techniques and customization
