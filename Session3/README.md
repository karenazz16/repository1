# Session 3 Homework: Object Oriented Programming

In this session we covered how in Data science there are three different types of programming paradigms (and completed 4 individual exercises as homework):

1. **Object-oriented programming** organizes code using objects that represent real-world entities. It provides modularity, code reuse and abstraction, making it suitable for handling large and complex applications.

2. **Functional programming** emphasizes the use of **pure functions** that can be easily composed and reused, ideal for transforming data.

3. **Declarative programming** consists in specifyin what the program should accomplish, rather than how to accomplish it.
